This is just a standard Leslie depletion estimation application.
One should set the start and end weeks to correspond to the start and
end of a fishing season. Obviously, all the normal issues with
assuming constant catchability are here. However, it is still helpful
to think about the patterns in CPUE, catch and effort.  The
fishermen seem to think they typically catch all of the legal males.
